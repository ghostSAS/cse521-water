# cse521-autowater project
CSE521S Project

## Hardware 

### Explanation of files 
* **main.py** achieves the 
  * sensor reading for every 1 second
  * data transfering to IoT for every 5 second
* **helperFun.py**: defines multiple functions (actuators, etc) and classes
* **awsFun.py**: defines functions related to the communication with the cloud server
* **sensorFun.py**: defines functions realted to the communication with the sensors



* **local_water_pump** achieves the 
  * sensor reading for every second
  * directly read the sensor data and decide to active the pump or not
